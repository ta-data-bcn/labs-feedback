### Hypothesis testing
Reference: [Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/ta-data-bcn/lab-hypothesis-testing)

Claudia - General - We need to have a challenge with an hypothesis that is rejected in the one-sided test but accepted in the two sided. This way students understand better the difference between the two types.

Eva - Typo - In challenge-1.ipynb, there is a typo in the definition of the paired t-test. The function used in scipy is ttest_rel and not ttest_re. 

Eva - General - In the data-labs repo, solutions are included. It would be better if the solutions were not visible for students.  

Eva - General - In challenge-1.ipynb and challenge-2.ipynb, explanations about when to reject the null hypothesis talk about p-values but do not relate them to a certain confidence level. I think that this can be confusing for students.
